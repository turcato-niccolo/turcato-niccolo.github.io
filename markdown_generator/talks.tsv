Our team secured first place in the competition by leveraging Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, competing against two teams that employed Model-Free Reinforcement Learning. This success underscores the efficacy of our approach in controlling underactuated robots.
Team: Alberto Dalla Libera, Niccolo' Turcato, Giulio Giacomuzzo, Ruggero Carli and Diego Romeres.
