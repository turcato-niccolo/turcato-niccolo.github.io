        <h2>Teaching a Robot to Toss Arbitrary Objects with Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</h2>
        <p>Niccolò Turcato, Alberto Dalla Libera, Giulio Giacomuzzo, Ruggero Carli</p>
        <p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of ModelBased Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) for pick-and-throw tasks, which is a variation of the pick-and-place task. In pick-and-throw applications, objects are thrown instead of placed to increase time efficiency and enlarge the workspace reachable by the robot. The effectiveness of analytical methods for this task is limited by the complex system dynamics and the disturbances due to communication and control. Recently, the application of data-driven solutions, in particular Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (MFRL), has attracted attention. In this paper, we explore the use of a MBRL algorithm to solve the pick-and-throw task. Experiments carried out in simulation show the potentialities of our approach, in terms of accuracy and data efficiency, both with respect to analytical methods and a MFRL approach.</p>

        <h2>Reinforcement learning for athletic intelligence: Lessons from the 1st “ai olympics with realaigym” competition</h2>

        <p>Abstract: As artificial intelligence gains new capabilities, it becomes important to evaluate it on real-world tasks. In particular, the fields of robotics and reinforcement learning (RL) are lacking in standardized benchmarking tasks on real hardware. To facilitate reproducibility and stimulate algorithmic advancements, we held an AI Olympics competition at IJCAI 2023 conference based on the double pendulum system in the RealAIGym project where the participants were asked to develop a controller for the swing up and stabilization task. This paper presents the methods and results from the top participating teams and provides insights into the realworld performance of RL algorithms with respect to a baseline time-varying LQR controller.</p>
