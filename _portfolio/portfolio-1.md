<h1>Abstract of the course</h1>
Humans and other animals still substantially outperform classic robots in performance, reliability, and
efficiency. Interestingly, their physical characteristics differ substantially from those of robots. Elastic tendons,
ligaments, and muscles enable animals to interact robustly with the external world and perform dynamic
tasks. On the contrary, traditional robots have generally been very stiff and heavyweight. Therefore, robotics
researchers have departed from the as-stiff-as-possible principle in favor of lightweight and compliant
structures. Taking inspiration from the natural example, elastic and soft components are included in the robot
design, yielding flexible joint or flexible link robots and, more recently, articulated and continuum soft robots.
The latter are entirely made of continuously deformable elements, bringing them close to invertebrate
animals. This recent explosion of new robotic concepts opened up the avenue of developing effective control
strategies to manage the soft body, a nonlinear mechanical system with a large – possibly infinite – number
of DOFs and, as a result, also a large degree of underactuation from the control point of view. This course
aims at introducing such control challenge. We will review established results in the field, introduce the most
recent advances, and discuss interesting open issues.
